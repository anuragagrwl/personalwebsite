    <h1>Poor Charlie's Wisdom by Charles T. Munger</h1>
    <p class="date">April 2023</p>
    <div class="prose">
      <p>A collection of speeches and talks by Berkshire Hathaway Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, offering wisdom on decision-making, investing, and living a rational life.</p>
      
      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mental Models:</strong> Munger advocates for creating a "latticework of mental models" from various disciplines to help make better decisions</li>
        <li><strong>Cognitive Biases:</strong> Understanding the psychology of human misjudgment and how to avoid common cognitive pitfalls</li>
        <li><strong>Circle of Competence:</strong> Knowing what you know and what you don't know, and staying within your area of expertise</li>
        <li><strong>Inverse Thinking:</strong> Solving problems backward (e.g., "Invert, always invert")</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Personal Takeaways</h2>
      <p>Munger's multidisciplinary approach to problem-solving has deeply influenced my product decision-making. His concept of mental models helped me bridge my technical background with business strategy. I now consciously try to think from multiple perspectives when evaluating product features or market opportunities.</p>
      
      <h2>Favorite Quote</h2>
      <p>"In my whole life, I have known no wise people who didn't read all the time—none, zero... You'd be amazed at how much Warren [Buffett] reads—and how much I read. My children laugh at me. They think I'm a book with a couple of legs sticking out."</p>
      
      <h2>Recommendation</h2>
      <p>Essential reading for anyone interested in improving their thinking process. Unlike many business books that focus on specific tactics, Munger provides a framework for clear thinking that applies across domains and remains relevant regardless of trends.</p>
