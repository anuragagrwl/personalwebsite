    <h1>The Lean Startup by Eric Ries</h1>
    <p class="date">March 18, 2025</p>
    <div class="prose">
      <p>A great book on building startups with a focus on validated learning and iterative development. Key takeaway: test ideas early with minimal resources.</p>
      
      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Build-Measure-Learn:</strong> The fundamental activity of a startup is to turn ideas into products, measure how customers respond, and then learn whether to pivot or persevere.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimum Viable Product (MVP):</strong> The version of a new product that allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.</li>
        <li><strong>Validated Learning:</strong> The process of demonstrating empirically that a team has discovered valuable truths about a startup's present and future business prospects.</li>
        <li><strong>Innovation Accounting:</strong> A quantitative approach that allows startups to prove objectively that they are learning how to grow a sustainable business.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Personal Takeaways</h2>
      <p>I've applied the Lean Startup methodology in my work at 5X, particularly when building our data platform. We started with a minimal viable product that addressed the core needs of our users, then iteratively improved based on feedback and usage metrics.</p>
      
      <p>The concept of "validated learning" has been especially valuable in my product management approach, helping me prioritize features that deliver real value rather than those that merely seem interesting.</p>
      
      <h2>Recommendation</h2>
      <p>I highly recommend this book to anyone building products or starting a business. The principles are applicable across industries and can save significant time and resources by focusing efforts on what truly matters.</p>
