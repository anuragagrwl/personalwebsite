    <h1>Turn Your Lights On by Gerald M. Weinberg</h1>
    <p class="date">April 2023</p>
    <div class="prose">
      <p>A guide to becoming more observant and analytical in identifying and solving problems, particularly in software development and complex systems.</p>
      
      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Becoming a Better Observer:</strong> Techniques for improving awareness and observation skills</li>
        <li><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> Identifying recurring patterns in problems and solutions</li>
        <li><strong>The Rule of Three:</strong> Always have at least three different interpretations of any observation</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback Loops:</strong> Creating effective feedback mechanisms to detect problems early</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Personal Takeaways</h2>
      <p>Weinberg's approach to observation and problem-solving has transformed how I approach product development. I've learned to question initial assumptions and look for patterns across seemingly unrelated issues. This has been particularly valuable when diagnosing complex issues in our data platform where the root cause often wasn't immediately obvious.</p>
      
      <h2>Favorite Quote</h2>
      <p>"If you don't know what you're doing, it's harder to do what you want."</p>
      
      <h2>Recommendation</h2>
      <p>Highly recommended for product managers, engineers, and anyone working with complex systems. The book provides practical frameworks for observation and problem-solving that can be applied immediately to improve how you approach challenges.</p>
