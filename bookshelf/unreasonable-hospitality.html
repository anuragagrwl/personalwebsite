    <h1>Unreasonable Hospitality by Will Guidara</h1>
    <p class="date">November 2023</p>
    <div class="prose">
      <p>A guide to creating extraordinary experiences for customers by applying the principles of world-class hospitality, written by the former co-owner of Eleven Madison Park, once named the world's best restaurant.</p>
      
      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Unreasonable Hospitality:</strong> Going beyond what's reasonable or expected to create memorable experiences</li>
        <li><strong>Enlightened Hospitality:</strong> Prioritizing care for employees first, then extending that care to customers</li>
        <li><strong>Yes is the Answer:</strong> Cultivating a culture where the default response is to find ways to accommodate requests</li>
        <li><strong>Creating Moments:</strong> Identifying opportunities to transform ordinary interactions into extraordinary memories</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Personal Takeaways</h2>
      <p>Guidara's perspective has significantly influenced how I think about customer experience in technology products. At 5X, I implemented a "dream manager" approach inspired by the book, where we dedicate resources to understanding our clients' biggest aspirations and aligning our solutions accordingly. This has transformed many transactional relationships into true partnerships.</p>
      
      <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
      <p>I've applied the concept of "creating moments" to our customer journey, identifying key milestones where we can deliver unexpected value. For example, we now create personalized data insight reports for executives after the first month of implementation, highlighting specific business opportunities discovered through our platform. These moments of delight have dramatically improved retention and expanded our relationships.</p>
      
      <h2>Favorite Quote</h2>
      <p>"Hospitality is present when something happens for you. It is absent when something happens to you."</p>
      
      <h2>Recommendation</h2>
      <p>Highly recommended for anyone in a customer-facing role, regardless of industry. While the examples come from fine dining, the principles of making people feel seen and valued are universal. Guidara provides a compelling case that genuine care and attention to detail create more lasting business success than efficiency alone.</p>
