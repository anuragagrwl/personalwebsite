    <h1>$100M Offers by Alex Hormozi</h1>
    <p class="date">April 2023</p>
    <div class="prose">
      <p>Alex Hormozi's $100M Offers provides a framework for creating irresistible business offers that transform ordinary products into high-value, high-conversion propositions.</p>
      
      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Value Equation:</strong> Hormozi introduces a formula for creating high-value offers: Dream Outcome ร Perceived Likelihood of Achievement รท Time Delay รท Effort & Sacrifice = Value</li>
        <li><strong>Grand Slam Offer:</strong> Combines irresistible value with urgency, making it "stupid" for customers to say no</li>
        <li><strong>Value Stacking:</strong> Adding multiple layers of value to your offer without increasing delivery costs</li>
        <li><strong>Risk Reversal:</strong> Removing objections by taking on the risk yourself</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Personal Takeaways</h2>
      <p>This book changed how I think about product offerings. In my work at 5X, I applied the value stacking principle by bundling complementary data services that increased perceived value without significantly raising our delivery costs. The focus on providing a "dream outcome" rather than just features also influenced how we positioned our data platform.</p>
      
      <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
      <p>The concept of "before and after states" helps clarify what customers truly want. It's not just about the technical aspects of what you're selling but the transformation your customers experience. I've started implementing this in how we communicate about our products, focusing on what new capabilities customers will have rather than just listing features.</p>
      
      <h2>Recommendation</h2>
      <p>Essential reading for anyone in business development, marketing, or product. Hormozi provides practical, actionable frameworks that can be applied immediately to increase conversion rates and customer value perception.</p>
