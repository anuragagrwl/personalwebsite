    <h1>The Secrets of Consulting by Gerald M. Weinberg</h1>
    <p class="date">March 2024</p>
    <div class="prose">
      <p>A guide to the art and practice of consulting, filled with practical wisdom about influencing change and providing value as an advisor, consultant, or leader.</p>
      
      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>The Law of Raspberry Jam:</strong> "The wider you spread it, the thinner it gets" - insights about influence and effectiveness</li>
        <li><strong>The Orange Juice Test:</strong> A method for establishing trust and setting appropriate fees</li>
        <li><strong>The Ten Percent Solution:</strong> Guidelines for creating meaningful change without triggering resistance</li>
        <li><strong>Consultant's Paradoxes:</strong> Understanding the counterintuitive aspects of influencing organizations</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Personal Takeaways</h2>
      <p>Weinberg's insights about the politics and psychology of organizational change have been invaluable in my consulting work at 5X. His advice to "be the catalyst, not the reaction" has helped me position myself more effectively as an advisor rather than an implementer. I've found that my effectiveness increases dramatically when I focus on helping clients discover their own solutions rather than prescribing mine.</p>
      
      <h2>Favorite Laws and Rules</h2>
      <p>The "Law of Influence" has been particularly useful: "The more you try to influence someone, the less influential you become." This counter-intuitive insight has changed my approach to persuasion, focusing more on asking powerful questions than making forceful arguments. I also frequently apply the "Fast Food Rule": "Never eat in a restaurant where staff wear costumes if you can avoid it"—a reminder to look for substance over style.</p>
      
      <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
      <p>I've adopted Weinberg's approach to setting the right expectations with clients, being clear about what I can and cannot accomplish. This has led to more successful engagements with clearer boundaries. His advice on pricing has also been transformative—charging based on value rather than time has allowed me to be fairly compensated while ensuring clients receive appropriate attention to their highest-value problems.</p>
      
      <h2>Recommendation</h2>
      <p>Essential reading not just for consultants but for anyone who needs to influence without direct authority. The book's wisdom applies equally well to product managers, team leads, and executives. Weinberg's use of humor and storytelling makes complex political and psychological insights accessible and memorable.</p>
