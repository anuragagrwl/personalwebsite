    <h1>Universal Methods of Design by William Lidwell, Kritina Holden, Jill Butler</h1>
    <p class="date">February 2024</p>
    <div class="prose">
      <p>A comprehensive reference of design research methods, offering a practical guide to 100 different techniques for understanding users and creating better products.</p>
      
      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>User-Centered Design:</strong> Techniques for understanding user needs and incorporating them into the design process</li>
        <li><strong>Research Methods:</strong> A diverse toolkit of approaches for gathering insights about users and contexts</li>
        <li><strong>Design Principles:</strong> Fundamental concepts that guide effective design decisions</li>
        <li><strong>Testing Techniques:</strong> Methods for evaluating designs with users to validate and improve solutions</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Personal Takeaways</h2>
      <p>This book has become an invaluable reference in my product development work. At 5X, I implemented several of the research methods described, including contextual inquiry and cognitive mapping, to better understand how data analysts were actually using our platform. These insights revealed significant gaps between our assumptions and actual usage patterns, leading to a major redesign of our analytics dashboard.</p>
      
      <h2>Most Useful Methods</h2>
      <p>The "Jobs to Be Done" framework has been particularly valuable in our product planning. By focusing on what users are trying to accomplish rather than feature requests, we've been able to design more elegant solutions that address underlying needs. I've also found great value in the "Think-Aloud Protocol" for usability testing, which has helped identify friction points in our user experience that weren't apparent from metrics alone.</p>
      
      <h2>Practical Applications</h2>
      <p>We've adopted several of the ideation techniques from the book, including affinity diagramming and design charrettes, into our product development process. These structured approaches have improved the quality of our brainstorming sessions and ensured we consider a wider range of solutions before converging on a direction. The emphasis on prototyping methods has also influenced our development workflow, encouraging more rapid testing of concepts before committing to implementation.</p>
      
      <h2>Recommendation</h2>
      <p>Essential reference for anyone involved in product design. Unlike many design books that focus on theory, this one provides actionable techniques that can be immediately applied to real-world challenges. The format makes it easy to find appropriate methods for specific situations, making it useful regardless of your experience level.</p>
